Project Title: Event Management System

Overview:
The Event Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the planning, organization, and management of events. This project involves collecting and analyzing user requirements, and then utilizing SQL, CSS, C#.NET, and Visual Studio for development. The system provides users with tools to create, manage, and track events efficiently.

Objectives:

To develop a user-friendly interface for event planning and management.
To provide features that allow for the creation, updating, and tracking of events.
To ensure seamless data management and retrieval using SQL.
To deliver a robust and secure application using C#.NET and Visual Studio.
Roles and Responsibilities:

Requirement Collection and Analysis: Engaged with stakeholders to gather and document detailed requirements.
Database Design: Designed and implemented the database schema using SQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Front-End Development: Utilized CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
Back-End Development: Developed the business logic and server-side functionality using C#.NET.
Integration and Testing: Integrated various modules and performed comprehensive testing to ensure functionality and performance.
Key Features:

Event Creation: Users can create new events, specifying details such as name, date, time, location, and description.
Event Management: Tools to edit, delete, and update event information.
User Registration: Allows users to register and log in to manage their events.
RSVP Management: Enables attendees to RSVP to events and manage their attendance.
Reporting: Generates reports on event attendance, user engagement, and feedback.
Technologies Used:

SQL: For database design, implementation, and management.
CSS: For designing a responsive and user-friendly front-end.
C#.NET: For back-end development and business logic implementation.
Visual Studio: As the integrated development environment (IDE) for building, debugging, and deploying the application.
Development Process:

Requirement Collection: Conducted interviews and surveys with potential users to gather functional and non-functional requirements.
Analysis: Analyzed the gathered requirements to create a comprehensive requirement specification document.
Design: Designed the database schema, user interfaces, and overall system architecture.
Development: Developed the application using C#.NET in Visual Studio, styled with CSS, and integrated with an SQL database.
Testing: Conducted unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the application meets the specified requirements.
Deployment: Deployed the application to a web server and provided user training and documentation.
Outcome:
The Event Management System successfully streamlined the event planning and management process, providing users with an efficient and reliable platform. The use of SQL ensured robust data management, while CSS and C#.NET enabled the creation of a responsive and functional web application.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a thorough understanding of the software development lifecycle, from requirement gathering and analysis to design, development, and deployment. The Event Management System project showcases proficiency in SQL, CSS, C#.NET, and Visual Studio, resulting in a well-rounded, functional, and user-friendly application.
